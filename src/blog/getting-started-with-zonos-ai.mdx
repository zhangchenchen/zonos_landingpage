# Getting Started with Zonos AI: A Practical Guide

Welcome to Zonos AI! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to start using our text-to-speech technology in your projects. Whether you're a developer, content creator, or business user, we'll help you get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (4GB+ VRAM) for optimal performance
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Git installed on your system

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zonos-ai/zonos
cd zonos
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Model Weights
```python
from zonos import download_weights

download_weights('transformer-v0.1')  # For transformer model
download_weights('ssm-v0.1')         # For SSM hybrid model
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Basic Text-to-Speech
```python
from zonos import ZonosAI

# Initialize the model
model = ZonosAI(model_type='transformer')

# Generate speech
audio = model.synthesize(
    text="Hello, this is Zonos AI speaking!",
    speaker="default",
    emotion="neutral"
)

# Save the audio
audio.save("output.wav")
```

### Voice Cloning
```python
# Clone a voice from an audio file
model.clone_voice(
    reference_audio="speaker.wav",
    output_path="cloned_voice.wav",
    text="This is the cloned voice speaking"
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Emotion Control
```python
# Generate speech with different emotions
emotions = ["happy", "sad", "excited", "calm"]
for emotion in emotions:
    audio = model.synthesize(
        text="This is an example of emotional speech",
        emotion=emotion,
        intensity=0.8
    )
    audio.save(f"{emotion}_speech.wav")
```

### Multilingual Support
```python
# Generate speech in different languages
text_samples = {
    "en": "Hello, world!",
    "zh": "你好，世界！",
    "ja": "こんにちは、世界！",
    "fr": "Bonjour le monde!",
    "de": "Hallo Welt!"
}

for lang, text in text_samples.items():
    audio = model.synthesize(
        text=text,
        language=lang
    )
    audio.save(f"{lang}_speech.wav")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Model Selection
- Use transformer model for highest quality
- Use SSM model for faster inference
- Consider your specific requirements

### 2. Performance Optimization
```python
# Enable batch processing for multiple texts
texts = ["First sentence", "Second sentence", "Third sentence"]
model.batch_synthesize(
    texts=texts,
    batch_size=4
)
```

### 3. Resource Management
```python
# Proper resource cleanup
with ZonosAI() as model:
    audio = model.synthesize(text="Hello")
    audio.save("hello.wav")
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Content Creation
```python
# Generate narration for a video
model.synthesize_file(
    script_file="script.txt",
    output_format="wav",
    sampling_rate=44100
)
```

### 2. Real-time Applications
```python
# Stream audio in real-time
model.stream_synthesize(
    text_stream=text_generator(),
    buffer_size=1024
)
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. CUDA out of memory
   - Reduce batch size
   - Use model compression
   - Clear cache regularly

2. Audio quality issues
   - Check input text formatting
   - Adjust sampling rate
   - Verify model weights
